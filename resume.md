# Brekk Bockrath

I am a software engineer with a deep focus on JavaScript. I am well-versed in providing a good user experience built with clean and simple software. I've served in a range of roles, from individual contributor to front-end technical lead of a small front-end team of eight. I enjoy mentoring and sharing knowledge, especially when working with active learners.

I learn quickly and I'm passionate about building both clean, data-driven interfaces and the frameworks that power them. I love anything that lives in the front-end or JavaScript. For the past few years I've been learning and trying to teach the patterns of functional programming &mdash; I'm still a journeyman but I am very excited by the clarity, ease-of-maintenance and safety that FP provides. I'm fascinated by the visualizations of complex systems and programs which can be run on themselves.

Here are some open-source modules I've published:

- [katsu-curry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/katsu-curry) for multiple different flavors of currying in JS
- [handrail](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handrail) for adding safety to functional composition pipelines 
- [entrust](https://www.npmjs.com/package/entrust) to allow for delegatee-last tacit programming
- [blem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blem) to facilitate the creation of BEM-syntax style selectors
- [snang](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snang) for tacit programming in the command line
